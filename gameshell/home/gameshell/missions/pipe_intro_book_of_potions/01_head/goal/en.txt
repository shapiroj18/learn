Mission goal
============

A forgetful old hermit called Servillus has set up camp in a cave 
with his old, leather-bound potion book.
Go to the cave and help him remember the recipe of his famous herbal 
tea.

In order to validate the mission, you need to be in the cave with 
Servillus **and** your last command prior to ``gsh check`` must show 
the recipe (including its title), but nothing else.
